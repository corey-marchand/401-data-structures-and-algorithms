# Challenge Summary
We will create stacks and be able to add values and delete values using the FIFO approach. 

## Challenge Description
You will need to write two methods on a PseudoQueue class.  THe first mthod (enqueue) will insert a value in the the PseudoQueue using the FIFO approach and the second method (dequeue) will extract a value using the FIFO approach as well.

## Approach & Efficiency
THe code should be very effiecient.  It is just a bunch of coditional statements so for time is should only take up O(1) at most and for space it should be O(n). The approach is easy for enqueue, because you know that you just have to push the accepted value.  For dequeue, i knew i was going to need a bunch of conditional statements to cover all the grounds of cases so it works.
