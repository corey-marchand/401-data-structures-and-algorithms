When they are merged is is [4, 23].  On pass two, the left is 8 and the right is the freshly merged [4, 23]. THen those are merged together and combine as [4, 8, 23].  Then during pass three, the left is now 16, the right now 15, and is it [15, 16] when it is merged.   During pass 4, the left is 42, the right is [15, 16] and it is  [15, 16, 42] when it is all merged.  Then on the 5th pass, the left is [4, 8, 23] the right is [15, 16, 42] and is merged to be [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] which is the final array sorted.",
