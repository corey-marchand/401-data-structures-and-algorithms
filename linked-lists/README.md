Code Challenges 401 - Linked Lists #08- By Corey Marchand

# Challenge Summary
* Create a function called mergedLL that takes in two different lists.  In the function, we are going to assign list heads to variables and create a new Linked list.  From there we will have a while loop with the condition of current 1 or current 2.  There will be two If statements in the while loop that will have arguements of either current1 or current2 and insid the if statements it will append current1.value and current2.value to zipper variable and outside the while loop I will return zipper variable. 

# Challenge Description
* Create a function that takes in two linked lists and merges both of them into a zipped like faction.

# Approach & Efficiency
