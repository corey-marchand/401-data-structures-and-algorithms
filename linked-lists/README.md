Code Challenges 401 - Singly Linked Lists #05- By Corey Marchand

# Challenge Summary
* We had to create three methods for a linked list data structure.  These methods were called toString, includes, and append.  For the append method, I had to assign a node to the head if no node existed.  THe includes method has to take in any value and return a boolean depending whether or not the value exists.  And toString method has to return the values of the linked List as a string.   

# Challenge Description
* Create a function that takes in two linked lists and merges both of them into a zipped like faction.

# Approach & Efficiency
* I know I needed to create a a new node in order to do anything, then from there i just tried different solutions in codesandbox until one worked. It should run really smooth since i didnt use any loops.  The big o should just be O(n) i believe.
