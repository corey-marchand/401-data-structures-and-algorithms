Code Challenges 401 - FizzBuzz - By Corey Marchand

# Challenge Summary
* Create a function called fizzBuzz that takes in a tree as an parameter.  Within the function, have a while statement that goes through the tree.  If the number of the node is divisible by 3, then replace the node value with fizz.  If the number of the node is divisible by 5, then replace the node value with buzz.  If the number of the node is divisible by 3 and 5, then replace the node value with fizz-buzz.   

# Challenge Description
*  Write a function that takes in a tree and if the node value is divisible by 3, return fizz. If the node value is divisible by 5, replace the value with buzz.  And if the node value is divisible by both 5 and 3 then replace the value with fizzbuzz
