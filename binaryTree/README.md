Code Challenges 401 -Find Max Value code challenge #18- By Corey Marchand

# Challenge Summary
* Create a function that takes in a binary tree and returns the maximum value.  In order to do this, You will need an if statement that argues if this.root is null then to return an error(edge case).  Next, you will need to assign this.root to a currentNode then enter a while loop that argues that if currentNode.right does not equal null  then assign currentNode to currentNode.right.  Finally return currentNode.data
